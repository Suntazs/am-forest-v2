    { "question": "What is the forest property price per hectare in Latvia in 2024?", "answer": "Forest property prices in Latvia in 2024 range from 2,000 to 8,000 EUR per hectare depending on tree species, age, quality, and location. Pine and spruce stands with good accessibility and 40-80 years of age reach the highest prices. AM Forest offers free professional assessment to determine the exact market value of your forest property." },
    { "question": "How to sell a forest property in Latvia — step by step?", "answer": "Forest property selling process: 1) Contact AM Forest for a free consultation, 2) Our experts perform a professional forest inventory and assessment, 3) Receive a fair price offer within 48 hours, 4) We process all documents at the notary, 5) Money is transferred immediately after the transaction. On average, the process takes 7-14 days." },
    { "question": "Is it more profitable to sell forest with a timber stand or after harvesting?", "answer": "AM Forest buys forest properties in all conditions — both with ready timber stands and after harvesting. Unharvested forest with mature stands (60-80 years) is often more valuable as the buyer has more freedom of choice. Harvested properties with young stands (5-20 years) are also in demand for long-term investments. We ensure a competitive price regardless of forest condition." },
    { "question": "What documents are needed for selling a forest property?", "answer": "For forest sale you need: land register certificate, forest inventory data (not older than 10 years), personal identification document, and tax payment confirmation. AM Forest helps arrange missing documents, performs new inventory at no cost, and provides legal support throughout the transaction process, including communication with the State Forest Service." }

  "perkamCirsmuFaq": [
    { "question": "What is the timber stand price per cubic meter in Latvia in 2024?", "answer": "Timber stand prices in Latvia in 2024 range from 35 to 85 EUR per cubic meter depending on tree species, quality, diameter, and accessibility. Pine and spruce stands with large-diameter trees and good accessibility reach the highest prices. AM Forest offers free professional assessment to determine the exact market value of your timber stand." },
    { "question": "How to sell a timber stand in Latvia — step by step?", "answer": "Timber stand selling process: 1) Contact AM Forest for a free consultation, 2) Our experts perform a professional stand measurement and assessment, 3) Receive a fair price offer within 24 hours, 4) We process the timber stand purchase agreement, 5) Money is transferred immediately after signing. On average, the process takes 3-7 days." },
    { "question": "Is it more profitable to sell a standing timber stand or harvested timber?", "answer": "AM Forest buys timber stands in all forms — both standing and already harvested timber. Standing timber is more convenient for the forest owner as all work is done by the buyer. Harvested timber can yield higher profit but requires additional investment and risk. We ensure a competitive price in both cases and can help choose the most profitable option." },
    { "question": "What factors affect the timber stand value?", "answer": "Main factors: tree species (pine, spruce, birch), tree diameter and height, timber quality (straightness, number of branches), accessibility (road quality, distance), stand size and concentration. AM Forest experts evaluate all these factors to offer the most favorable price for your timber stand." }
